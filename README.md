Algorithm Implementations

This repository contains clean and well-documented implementations of fundamental algorithms commonly used in computer science. The goal is to provide easy-to-understand reference code for students, educators, and researchers.

ðŸ“˜ Overview

The repository includes implementations of algorithms in various categories such as:

Sorting Algorithms â€“ Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Insertion Sort, and more

Divide and Conquer â€“ Binary Search, Merge Sort, Matrix Multiplication, etc.

Greedy Algorithms â€“ Activity Selection, Huffman Coding, Fractional Knapsack, etc.

Dynamic Programming (DP) â€“ Longest Common Subsequence, Knapsack, Matrix Chain Multiplication, and more

Graph Algorithms â€“ Dijkstra, Kruskal, Prim, BFS, DFS, Topological Sort, etc.

Other Classic Techniques â€“ Recursion, Backtracking, and advanced problem-solving patterns

Each implementation is designed to be:

Readable â€“ with meaningful variable names and comments

Efficient â€“ following standard algorithmic complexity

Educational â€“ ideal for learning and teaching purposes
